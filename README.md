# MyRescue

A Flutter project for a mobile application targeted to be able to provide for cross platform users such as Android, iOS, and web. The application is a flood rescue management system which encourages the general public to volunteer themselves for Search and Rescue (SAR) operations under voluntary leaders from the fire department or relevant government agencies. The ultimate aim of MyRescue is to speed up the SAR efficiency, and manage resources during a natural crisis better.
